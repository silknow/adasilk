## About

The SILKNOW Exploratory Search Engine is named after Ada Lovelace (1815-1852), the mathematician that anticipated some of the main features of modern computing some 100 years before its advent. In her notes, she wrote that such a computation machine _
weaves algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves_.
